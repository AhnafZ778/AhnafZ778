# 👋 Hi, I’m Ahnaf Bin Zakaria

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a **Python-focused developer** with a passion for building practical solutions and learning by doing. While Python is my main tool, I also work comfortably with **Java**, **HTML5**, and **CSS**, bringing ideas to life from rough sketches to clean, well-structured code.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

- **Clarity over flash:** My projects emphasize readability and maintainability. You won't just see polished "final products" here—expect to find clear, incremental improvements and honest documentation of the process.
- **Practical problem solving:** I love making scripts, tools, and small utilities that solve real problems. Instead of chasing giant frameworks, I focus on what’s useful now.
- **Intentional learning:** I document my mistakes, share refactors, and highlight what I learn along the way. Transparency and growth matter more to me than perfection.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Java, HTML5, CSS
- **Focus Areas:** Data structures, algorithms, testability, and architectural clarity
- **Current Goals:** Strengthen core fundamentals and ship small, useful things consistently
